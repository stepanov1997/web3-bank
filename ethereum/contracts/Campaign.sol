    // As of Solidity 0.7.0, an unsafe feature related to mappings in Structs was removed.
    // If a struct or array contains a mapping, it can only be used in storage. Prior to 0.7.0,
    // mapping members were silently skipped in memory, which is confusing and error-prone.
    //
    // So the line which is given in the course code:
    //
    // Request[] public requests;
    //
    // now becomes the following 2 lines of code. Also in the createRequest
    // function, instead of creating a memory Struct, which the code was proviously
    // doing, we now have to create a storage Struct.
    //
    // And finally, wherever the course code has the line `requests.length` gets replaced
    // by `numRequests`.
